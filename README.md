# utility

Repo which uses basic physics conversion functions to make quick calculations in a jupyter notebook

Mostly will contain utility code to help me get better at coding by practicing various useful coding projects and recording 
all my research calculations for the lab

# conductance calculations
Conductance is calculated by measuring the quantity of gas (the volume of the gas at a known pressure) that passes
a plane in a known time divided by the difference in pressure at two points where the pressure is measured. It is a
purely geometrical quantity that does not depend on pressure, but rather the type of gas, and the geometry.
